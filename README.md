<summary>Game Overview</summary>
<br>

Music Non Stop is a card game that trains your brain to improve your memory while bringing the beauty of classical music to your ears. Designed for music lovers of all ages, this game challenges players to match pairs of cards that play the same classical tune. There are 24 cards featuring 12 unique pairs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to play</summary>
<br>

1. The game will start the timer as soon as you begin.
2. Click on any two cards to flip them over and listen to the tunes.
3. If the cards play the same tune, you have found a match. The cards will remain face up.
4. If the cards do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
5. Keep selecting two cards at a time, trying to remember the tunes and their locations.
6. The game ends when all pairs have been matched.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Scoring</summary>
<br>

- The scoring system rewards players with extra points for faster card matches. The quicker you match the cards, the more points you earn. Extra points are calculated based on the time between card picks. The game also saves your score and time, which are displayed at the end and recorded on the scoreboard.
- The game involves flipping cards and matching pairs. Points are awarded based on how quickly the pairs are matched.
- The top 10 players, ranked by their scores in descending order, are displayed on the scoreboard.
- Players can earn additional bonus points by answering trivia questions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips for Success</summary>
<br>

1. Pay close attention to the tunes that each card plays.
2. Try to remember the location of each tune to make matching easier.
3. Practice makes perfect! The more you play, the better you’ll get at remembering the tunes.

## Code Architecture and Key Components

### Main Game Control

<details>
<summary>main.js</summary><br>
 
The main.js file is crucial in our project as it serves as the central hub where all the functions are defined. This file acts as the pivot point of our website, orchestrating the various functionalities and ensuring that everything runs smoothly. Without it, the site would be a static display with no interactive features. Here’s what it controls:

- Game mechanics: Card flipping, matching, and score updates.
- Event handling: Managing user actions, such as clicking cards and answering trivia.
- Shuffling: Randomizing card order to keep the game fresh.
- Display: Dynamically updating the game board, score, and game-over screens.
- Game state management: Tracking uncovered cards, timing, and player progress.

</details>

### JavaScript Audio
The MP3Player class is responsible for handling audio playback during the game. It plays classical music when cards are flipped and controls audio functions like play, pause, and stop. 
The class is defined in mp3-player.js.

<details>
<summary>MP3Player Class Documentation</summary>

#### MP3Player

##### Constructor

The MP3Player class is responsible for handling audio playback during the game. It plays classical music when cards are flipped and controls audio functions like play, pause, and stop. The class is initialized with:

The constructor accepts two parameters **path** and **playlist**.

- **path**: The path to the folder with the mp3-files. The path is relative to the HTML document in which the script is loaded.
- **playlist**: An array of audio file names without the extension. All files must be in mp3 format. Example:

  <code>
  // array with mp3 filenames  
  const playlist = ["symphony1", "symphony2", "mozart-track1", "bach-track1"];  
  // path to the folder with the files  
  const path = "./js/audio/"  
  // create an instance of the mp3-player  
  const player = new MP3Player(path, playlist);  
  // Play the first track from the list (which is symphony1.mp3)  
  player.play(1);  
  </code>

##### Properties

- **audio**
- **playBtn**
- **stopBtn**
- **prevBtn**
- **nextBtn**
- **tracks**
- **audio_files_folder_path**
- **trackIndex**

##### Methods

The class implements all the essential methods for playing mp3 files:

- `play(n)`
- `stop()`
- `pause()`
- `prev()`
- `next()`

</details>

### Game Logic

<details>
<summary>Class Games</summary><br>

The game logic is defined in a class called Game. This class encapsulates the rules and the flow of the game.
It is decoupled from the presentation layer.

#### Game class

JavaScript class for game logic

##### Constructor

```constructor(cards, mp3player, gameOverCallback)```

The constructor takes a deck of cards(cards) a reference to the instance of the MP3Player for playing music.
And lastly a callback function, which a presentation layer component can supply, to execute when the game is over.

##### Important methods

- ```addScore(number)```: is used for adding some extra score to the current game
- ```pickCard(number)```: is used by the presentation layer to let the game know which card the player has picked
- ```addShowTriviaQuestionsCallback(callback)```: Add a callback function for the event when the trivia question need to appear
- ```addHideTriviaQuestionsCallback(callback)```: Add a callback function for the event when the trivia question need to dissapear
- ```stopPlayback()```: Stop the playback of whichever track is playing

#### GameCard class

This class encapsulates all the essential properties of a card for the game. 

##### Constructor

```constructor(index, trackIndex, name, backgroundColor, composerImage, faceImage)```

- index : the index of the associated card in the array, that is used by the Game object
- trackIndex : the index of the associated track in the playlist
- name : name of the audio file
- backgroundColor : background-color of the flipside of the card in case an image fails to load
- composerImage : path to the image of the associated composer
- faceImage : path to the image that is user as the face side of all the cards in the deck

##### Methods

This class only has the render() method, which renders it as a HTML-Element.

- [Lighthouse chrome devtool](/documentation/doc-image/lighthouse.webp)
- No warning or errors present in Dev Tools.
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/about/) was used to validate the JavaScript. We use the ES6 class property syntax for concise method declarations. Some tools may flag this as invalid, but it is fully supported in modern JavaScript environments. This project uses modern JavaScript (ES6+), including class properties and arrow functions for concise methods and proper `this` scoping. While some tools may flag this syntax, it is fully supported in modern environments. For compatibility with older browsers, consider using a transpiler like Babel. Result: **PASS**.

### Validation Notes
Regarding javascript: Vendor-specific warnings can be ignored if the code works in modern browsers. If issues arise in older environments, using Babel will help ensure compatibility.

The CSS used in this project, including the Font Awesome library, may generate some warnings when checked through the W3C CSS Validator. These warnings are related to:
1. **Vendor Prefixes**: Certain styles (e.g., `-webkit-` and `-moz-` prefixed properties) are flagged as vendor-specific extensions. These are included to ensure compatibility with older browsers and can safely be ignored.
2. **CSS Variables**: The validator may flag dynamic CSS variables (e.g., `var(--fa-animation-delay)`) because they cannot be statically analyzed. However, CSS variables are fully supported in modern browsers, and their use is intentional for flexible styling.

These warnings do not affect the functionality or appearance of the site. The styles are fully supported in all major browsers.
